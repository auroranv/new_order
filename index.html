   <p><em>NEW LIST →	NEW ORDER</em></p><br>
   <p>As a class, we put together a list of events, people, art, etc.
     that influenced our lives in important ways.
<br>I created a second list by reacting in associative ways and
linking each event to a new fact or story.
<br>To see the new meanings, match the pairings. You can also scroll each list individually.
</p><br><p>In the <span>first column</span> you can find the list of <span>entry pairings</span>.
   </p><p>To see the associatively linked entries, do the following:
   </p><p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;">Choose a pairing, for example, 007☞002.
   </p><p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;">Click 007 in the <span>second column</span> on the left.
   </p><p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;">And then click 002 on the <span>third column</span>.
   </p><p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;">When you're finished reading the pairing, click on any number in the <span>first column to reset</span> the page.

    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_1">
      <p><em>Yoga</em></p>
      <p>Starting to practice Yoga changed the way I treat myself significantly and gave ma a tool to deal with thoughts running around my head like crazy or to create a space for myself where I can regain energy.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_3">
      <p><em>Dead Sea</em><p/>
      <p>Loved the colors, the calmness and the kind of magical vibe. I’ve spent a few days there during a journey through Israel and met this guy who lived there in a tent, just <i>trying to come back to himself</i>. Though that’s a good place to do that and came back a little bit to myself after a major breakup.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_4">
      <p><em>Doric, Ionic, Corinthian (greek column styles)</em></p>
      <p>Three different subsequent architectural orders that defined the stylistic shape of the columns. The focus is on the capital: it starts with a very simple lined capital going to a duble volute/spiral capital, and ending with a nicely detailed leafed one.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_5">
      <p><em>Final Judgement (Hans Memling)</em></p>
      <p>Absolutely overwhelming work, a gem in the crown of my area's local art museum in Gdańsk. So full of colors, of meaning, symbolism. In the museum you could go around it to see its sponsors painted on the back. <i>The Final Judgement</i> had a whole room devoted to it, so the work fully consumed you. I always somehow connected it to <i>Last Supper</i> by DaVinci. <i>Last Supper</i> was hanging in our church (lame) (and of course a reproduction only, which I for long did not know) and Memling had a room in a museum, ha! Where you at, Leonardo?</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_6">
      <p><em>Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno</em></p>
      <p>Last summer I was in Italy and went to Genova, a beautiful city structured like a maze. In this city lays the most impressive graveyard I have ever seen in my life. There was a village of little houses that the familie had build for there deceased family member. There were corridors with massive statues that representated the life of that deceased person.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_7">
      <p><em>Alphonse Mucha</em></p>
      <p>Czech art nouveau painter and graphic artist. Designed posters, type, buildings, jewelry, clothing… and often did so for causes he believed in. So ahead of his time.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_8">
      <p><em>Pedro Salinas</em></p>
      <p>Spanish poet, member of the avantgarde Generation of ‘27. Poetic style is direct, simple, metaphorical and concise, and yet can convey multiple meanings at once. Genius in his humility. I often aim to have such a strong and poetic voice in my own work.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_9">
      <p><em>Jazz</em></p>
      <p>The first kind of music that I genuinely liked, not because it was cool or familiar from the radio, but because I was fascinated by the sounds of the saxophone. For some reason, I always feel very luxurious when I listen to it, like being in a New York bar somewhere in the 1920s.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_10">
      <p><em>The Cube personality test by Sigmunt Freud</em></p>
      <p>For some time I was really into analyzing people around me, how do they live, how did they grow up, what is important for them, what is their mindset. Its a test where you are asked to imagine yourself walking through the desert, and you encounter a cube. I gave this test over 60 people, I really learned about the imagination and connection to specific moments. This test is always time-related, it introduces the stranger to you the best, their inner self.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_11">
      <p><em>Master and Margarite</em></p>
      <p>My favorite book as a child. Written by Michail Bulgakov. Depicts the game of the devil who came to visit Moscow. One of the main characters is <i>Begemot</i> – the huge black cat of the devil that can play chess and ride the tram.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_13">
      <p><em>LEGO</em></p>
      <p>My biggest obsession ever. I played countless hours with those bricks. It sparked my fascination for making because I was mainly rebuilding things into city scenes and spaceships.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_14">
      <p><em>Thierry Mugler</em></p>
      <p>Thierry Mugler is a fashion designer that makes futuristic clothes for woman. In my opinion, he is a visionary. He works with the shape of a woman’s body and makes them through his clothes even more powerful.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_15">
      <p><em>Blue</em></p>
      <p>First time I saw the big blue painting in Stedelijk, the one by Barnett Newman. I just remember the feeling of being amazed by the number of colors and shades I saw. One of the most memorable but still new experiences with modern art. For me, it was the most complex simplicity. (the painting title is <i>Cathedra</i>)</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_17">
      <p><em>H. E. O. (Zbigniew Herbert)</em></p>
      <p>Short reinterpretation of a mythological story of Orpheus and Eurydice. Herbert reverses the usual narrative exposing Oprheus’ egotism and showing Eurydice’s new perspective. This poem opened my eyes to poetry and the fragment about the <i>eye of the volcano</i> was transcendental.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_18">
      <p><em>La Dolce Vita</em></p>
      <p>One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The combination of absurdity and beautiful imagery, humor and interesting narrative kept me mesmerized. </p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_19">
      <p><em>Family</em></p>
      <p>My family are each and every single one of them an inspiration daily to me. And their support helps me to be who I am. </p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_22">
      <p><em>One and Three Chairs (Joseph Kosuth)</em></p>
      <p>Conceptual piece of art consisiting of a chair, picture of a chair and a dictionary definition of a chair. In short: semantics, representation, essence of chairness,  Plato’s theory of forms. Which chair is most accurate? Where is the fourth chair? </p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_23">
      <p><em>Radio with a Recording Function</em></p>
      <p>It was a legendary moment to have an access to a radio with a recording function because not only it made my musical selcection from raido possible, but also it made me actively record my opinion to it.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_26">
      <p><em>Ambient Music</em></p>
      <p>My music tase was quite shallow for a long period of time. I remember when one of my friends introduced me to Brian Eno. I was instantly shocked by the album covers and the slow, progressive and minimal music. It was most important to me that he could master just 2 to 4 sounds to create a work, instead of over creating.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_27">
      <p><em>Zanele Muholi</em></p>
      <p>Zanele Muholi is a photographer based in South-Africa. She makes self-portraits that examines what it means to be black. She captures the lesbian identity in her country. Her photos are in black and white and are almost giving light.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_28">
      <p><em>Invisible Cities</em></p>
      <p>Great book written by Italo Calvino. The story is about Marco Polo who tells emperor Kublai Khan stories about all the cities in his empire. However, all cities that are described refer to Polo’s own city Venice. One of the few books that I have read from start to finish.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_29">
      <p><em>Ramses Shaffy - Laat me </em></p>
      <p>Let me be who I want to be' is something my father would say. This song describes his thoughts about life without him being with me anymore. Something that changed me in 2011 and still carriering with me nowadays.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_30">
      <p><em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em></p>
      <p>Science fiction series created by Douglas Adams. Originally a radio comedy broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978. Contains typical british humour. Addresses the topic of absurdity of everyday life. The broad narrative of Hitchhiker follows the misadventures of the last surviving man, Arthur Dent, following the demolition of the Earth.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_31">
      <p><em>John Lydon</em></p>
      <p>Once a junkie and rebel, an intellectual, a great musician, and a true punk. From him I know that anger can be beautiful</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_32">
      <p><em>Asparagus by Suzan Pitt</em></p>
      <p>A great visualisation of girls’ fear and desire towards sexuality. A very relevant work in my adolescence.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_33">
      <p><em>Depeche Mode</em></p>
      <p>In my little world, I learned to enjoy the silence. I could silently cry the uncessesary out. As I heard the voice of Dave Gahan piercing through me.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_34">
      <p><em>Architect Tadao Ando</em></p>
      <p>Moving to Prague and growing up a bit I explored Japanese architect Tadao Ando, he was my first favorite architect. His approach to architecture is so pure and magical for me, he connects emptiness with beauty. He gives a space a very specific special atmosphere which became almost the reason why I wanted to study architecture. The realization that you can get this goose skin experience from the building, thinking about it just relax my brain immediately. </p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_35">
      <p><em>西游记 Journey to The West</em></p>
      <p>One of the very first TV drama I got into when I was little. It has influenced me in so many aspects by its aesthetics, story-telling and philosophies.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_36">
      <p><em>Margarete Stokowski</em></p>
      <p>Writes columns and essays about feminism, current politics, social structures, sexuality and consent and stuff like that. She grew up in the same time as I did and I can relate to many things she writes about.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_38">
      <p><em>Fruit stickers</em></p>
      <p>I used to collect them when I was kid. I really liked the variety of colors and different visuals and illustrations.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_39">
      <p><em>Legowelt</em></p>
      <p>Dutch musician who goes by more than 20 different aliases. He produced huge amount of music spanning from chicago house-ish tracks to ambient. Great album titles and covers. One of the first impulses that made me explore electronic music, dutch music scene, istruments etc.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_42">
      <p><em>Dissolution of the Soviet Union</em></p>
      <p>Long story short I wouldn’t be here if that wouldn’t happen so…</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_44">
      <p><em>Dvojni C.</em></p>
      <p>A Slovenian fruit beverage, possibly the oldest continuously manufactured drink by Fructal. I would stop by the local supermarket on my way home from primary school to buy this small treat with whatever little money I had on me. I find it to exemplify wonderfully a certain epoch of Slovenian (Yugoslav) graphic design.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_45">
      <p><em>Golden Brava (Fiat car)</em></p>
      <p>Most insane and horrible color I've seen on a car, a metallic pastel gold on a shrunk family wagon. Grandpa taught me how to drive with this car on an abandoned landing strip.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_46">
      <p><em>Hell is Around the Corner - Tricky</em></p>
      <p>Tricky is a musician from Bristol that does a sort of trip-hop/electronic/experimental genre. Apart from being made in the year I was born, this video is extremely simple and repetitive, cheaply and easily produced, and massively red.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_47">
      <p><em>Nintendo 64</em></p>
      <p>Big part of my childhood I lived in a world of polygons. My mom told me that if I play to much I would get the form of poygons. Maybe they have,  because I still love the aesthetic</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_48">
      <p><em>Brenda Fassie - Memesa</em></p>
      <p>This one was a beautiful story of me dancing with my mom and my sisters on my birthday, when I was feeling a bit sad about the day, my mom put the music extremely loud and yelled: “schudden met je kut ivi” We died of laughter and danced for a proper hour together. This reminds me of a free, careless self that can even in times of sadness find the strength to enjoy and carry on.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_50">
      <p><em>An Embarkment on River Volga </em></p>
      <p>So far, I have noticed a pattern in my life - my spititual place in any city is always by the water. The embarkment in my home town is a special scene of my teenagehood.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_51">
      <p><em>Home Computer, Windows 98 and Internet</em></p>
      <p>A home computer with windows 98 and internet enabled my childhood privacy and access to the rest of the world.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_52">
      <p><em>Mario Party on Nintendo 64</em></p>
      <p>Playing marioparty created a sense of togetherness that didn't matter to the rest of the world. A moment that brought family and neighbors together for one thing: the game.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_53">
      <p><em>Bubblegum Pink (or Cotton Candy, #ffbcd9)</em></p>

      <p><em>The Knife</em></p>
      <p>Swedish music artist duo, formed in 1999. Album after album, this alternative group never ceased to impress me. Knowing The Knife as a teenager in Slovenia meant you were granted access to the “alternative” group with its endless parties and endless friendships.</p>

      <p><em>Patterns of Nature</em></p>
      <p>Spider webs, animal trails, natural textures on animals, insects, plants. These details of nature have always left a mark on me. If I see it I spend my time to observe and appreciate. It often seems like we, humans are the only ones with creative abilities, but it was clear to me that everything on this earth can be considered as art.</p>

      <p><em>Empathy</em></p>
      <p>Empathy is something I learned from my parents and spending a lot of time in nature. I think that it is really crucial to have empathy to really understand people, and the dynamic of the world. It’s essential to really pay attention to others and my surroundings. I have been able to gain and sense of awareness and curiosity from it, and it’s made me appreciate life more.</p>

      <p><em>The Forest</em></p>
      <p>I spent a lot of time in nature growing up. We lived next to a forest. If we went for a walk, the walk was in the forest, we spent our free time hiking in in different forests on the weekends, went to hike or bike around further mountains in our vacations. I grew up to the mindset that there is no better place to be than in nature. It taught me how to respect and love nature, how to observe the patterns and sounds. The cracks of ice of frozen paddles, when there is no water underneath. The crunchy sounds the branches make under our feet. The complex system of branches and the veins of tree leaves. It taught me how to how to stay silent to really feel part of the forest, because then I can truly observe how it really is. That the silence isn’t really silence, we just have to listen. </p>

      <p><em>Kispál és a Borz</em></p>
      <p>A band from Hungary, the favourite band of my father. Definitely the first musical experience I remember having, I grew up listening and dancing to their music, even though I didn’t fully understand it when I was younger. Their lyrics are complete poetry, Each of their songs can be read as poems as well, they use the Hungarian language playfully and effortlessly, and their music is also really good.</p>

      <p>When I got my discman, my 6 years older cousin would do a cd playlist for me with the songs that she downloaded. It was such a specific experience of the exploration of different music and not knowing what exactly I was listening to. I had found a friend who was also crazy about her and we would do random things what kids do. This led to liking emo and scene style, being inspired by it, crazy. </p>

You are aware of that the story is true and that he is trying to build up his forgotten past again together. But through the movie you kinda start to forget this. This is why the end is so powerful. Towards the end of the movie they switch from animated to real footage. It has a kind of shock effect to you because you forgot that this was real. The ending is one of the strongest parts.</p>

I learned another language, I was exposed to a lot of different people, cultures and ways of living.

    <br><p>Your friend introduced us, the one that says that it guesses future to come... I do not know what else to tell you, seated from the corridor on a shore. Do you remember me?
Give me the chair, tired of the corner where I waited for you, where I always waited for you. Love, I can give you some laughter, and make a song.
...And a polka dot handkerchief, I give you time for you to put it on. And a promise, girl:
If I find you one day, I plan to give you one of those kisses that you deserved. On the bridge of hope, I was looking for a little room for laughter, thinking it was worth it to love you. We spent little intense moments  and saw little corners  where we could fall in love. The street of thought, it takes me to that shore, I do not know if you remember. Give me the chair that has this charm. I pass by your door almost every day, I pass and you decide when to appear.
And they even came back from the rhymes, images playing, hanging onto I don’t know what. I’m sure it was April, they all came back to me, all but one that forgot about me.
That the handkerchief is to dry my tears shed over you, and there is no remedy for the one who composes. If I ever find you because of my cowardice,
I think you give all those kisses that you deserved.

    <p>The term third culture kid was first coined in the 1950's, as it is a very new phenomenon. TCK's are people raised in a culture other than their parents' or the culture of their country of nationality for a significant part of their early development years. TCKs move between cultures before they have had the opportunity to fully develop their personal and cultural identity. The first culture of such individuals refers to the culture of the country from which the parents originated, the second culture refers to the culture in which the family currently resides, and although not widely agreed upon by the TCK community, some sources refer to the third culture as the amalgamation of these two cultures.

    <p><b>Cautionary Tales</b></p><br>
<p>We tell our children unsettling fairy tales to teach them valuable life lessons, but these Cautionary Tales are for the education of the grown-ups — and they are all true. Tim Harford (Financial Times, BBC, author of <b>Messy</b> and <b>The Undercover Economist</b>) brings you stories of awful human error, tragic catastrophes, daring heists, and hilarious fiascos.
Galileo tried to teach us that adding more and more layers to a system intended to avert disaster often makes catastrophe all the more likely. His basic lesson has been ignored in nuclear power plants, financial markets and at the Oscars… all resulting in chaos. At the 2017 Academy Awards, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway famously handed the Best Picture Oscar to the wrong movie. In this episode of Cautionary Tales, Tim Harford takes us through all of the poor design choices leading into the infamous <b>La La Land/Moonlight debacle</b>, and how it could have been prevented.

    <p><b>The Construction of the New York City Subway: The Spanish Connection</b></p>
    <br><p>The City Hall subway station has very characteristic ceramic tiled vaulted ceilings. These are called the Guastavino Tile Arch System, it’s a version of Catalan vault introduced to the United States in 1885 by Valencian architect and builder Rafael Guastavino (1842–1908). Guastavino tile has both structural and aesthetic significance. Structurally, the timbrel vault was based on traditional vernacular vaulting techniques already very familiar to Mediterranean architects, but not well known in America. Even though it is relatively unknown, he is behind the most iconic buildings in New York, including the Manhattan Municipal Building and Ellis Island Great Hall. His technique survives him, as Guastavino tile is found in some of New York's most prominent Beaux-Arts landmarks and in major buildings across the United States, including the Grand Central Terminal, Carnegie Hall, the U.S. Supreme Court, and the National Museum of Natural History, among many others.
